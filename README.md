# ðŸš€ Ansible Configuration on AWS EC2

This guide walks through the process of setting up **Ansible** on AWS EC2 instances. We will configure one **master node** and two **worker nodes** to run Ansible automation tasks.

This project demonstrates the setup of Ansible on AWS EC2 instances for automated configuration management. Three Ubuntu servers were provisioned: 1 Master and 2 Workers. The master node was configured with Ansible, while workers were prepared with hostname updates, SSH access, and user privileges. Passwordless SSH was enabled using key-based authentication. Inventory files were updated with private IPs, and Ansible connectivity was verified using the ping module. There are executed across all nodes, showcasing centralized automation with Ansible.
